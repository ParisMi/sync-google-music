=================

Sync .m3u files with Google Music.

Basically a worse version of https://github.com/Tyris/m3uGoogleMusicSync, but this one is more lightweight. run the script. enter in your credentials to google music. the script automatically finds any .m3us in your directory, matches them to their counterpart in google play, and then uploads (or updates) the playlist in google play. It's a good stopgap if you need to just keep a few playlists sync'd and are hurting because google has no way to sync playlists or even music very well.
